# Maximum Matchings in Graphs

## Kidney Paired Donation

This is a classic graph theory problem. It was solved innefficiently by implementing the Galeâ€“Shapley algorithm and then in a more efficient manner using the longest chain first algorithm. 

## Patient donor pairs
The goal is to maximise life expectency for each patient whilst also making sure no one is worse off by switching donor pairs. This is explained in depth in the pdf document that is located in 
KidneyProjectCode/Documents/.
